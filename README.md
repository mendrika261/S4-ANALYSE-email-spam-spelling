# Overview üîÆ

Email system with spam detection, spelling check, AES encryption.

## Functionality üõ†Ô∏è
- Automatic spam detection
- Auto refresh model after (10) new emails, or manually after marking an email as spam
- Check spelling when writing an email
- AES encryption
- Send, receive, delete, mark as spam
- Status: received ... (read, unread)

## How it works üß†
- The spam detection uses data (only) generated by prompt from the OpenAI API - GPT Turbo 3.5
    - Make the email into UTF-8
    - Parse eventual HTML with BeautifulSoup
    - Remove links, mentions, hashtags, emails, numbers, punctuation, and stopwords
    - Stem the words using: PorterStemmer
    - Make Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) matrix
    - Train the model (limit 500 first features), and took LinearSVC as the best model
    - Save the model into file using joblib
- The spelling check uses the Levenshtein distance to find the most similar word in a French (lite) dictionary
